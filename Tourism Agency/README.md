# Tourism Agency Management Application

This project was developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at the university. It focuses on applying key concepts of object-oriented design and memory management, while also exploring design patterns and GUI development.

## Key Features:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The project emphasizes OOP principles, including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **STL Vector Class:** I implemented a portion of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) vector class using iterators and templates.
- **Design Patterns:** Incorporated patterns like the Observer pattern and Model-View-Controller (MVC).
- **GUI Development:** The application uses the Qt framework, and I learned how to work with signals and slots for event-driven programming.

## Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** Qt (for GUI development)
- **Design Patterns:** Observer, Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- **Tools:** C++ Standard Template Library (STL)

## Installation & Setup:
1. Clone the repository:
